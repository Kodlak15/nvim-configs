# My personal Nix based Neovim configuration

This is an opinionated Neovim configuration I have built over time for my own use cases. You can try it using `nix run github:Kodlak15/nvim-flake`, or use it as a reference to build your own configuration. 

## A few noteworthy out of the box features:

- Declarative configuration with Nixvim
- LSP
- Autocomplete with nvim-cmp
- Syntax highlighting with treesitter
- AI integration with Avante (bring your own API keys)
